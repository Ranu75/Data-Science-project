# Data Science Project

In this directory, you'll find all my mini-projects of Data Science. 
Mostly, I used examples of projects already completed by [Aman Kharwal](https://amanxai.com/2024/02/26/user-profiling-and-segmentation-using-python/). Otherwise, a few projects were imaginated and created by me. (cf. Finance projects)

## A-B Testing

## Anomaly detection

## Classification

## Elections Campaigns

## Finance

## Modelling insurance

## Predictions

## Recommendation system

## Supply chain

## Survival analysis
One project was focused on cancer. This mini-project allows to use the library **scikit-survival**. 

## Text analysis
One project was focused on the analysis of many articles about machine learning. To analyze it, we use the library **Blobbler** to visualize the global opinion of each article about machine learning.
